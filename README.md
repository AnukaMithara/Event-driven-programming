You need to create a course registration GUI by considering the following,
  1. Your first page should get the information like student name, student registration number, three course details (course code, course, credit), email, and advisor        name.
  2. Inputs should be validated.
  3. The first page should include a submit and reset button.
  4. Student name and student registration number must be entered for the submission.
  5. When submitted, the next page should show them in a proper format you decide.
